# WolfNotes

## Problem Statement

As college students our classes often consist of numerous different resources including lecture slides, lecture notes, textbooks, etc. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed trying to consolidate all that information into digestible study materials. For courses that don’t provide as many resources it becomes even harder and time-consuming to gather study resources. Although some solutions such as group chats or google drives exist it can easily get disorganized.

Our PWA, Wolf Notes, addresses this by creating a single, class-specific platform where students can upload, organize, and rate notes. This lets students easily find reliable study material, fill gaps in understanding, and prepare for exams without starting from scratch. Due to the PWA’s capabilities in working offline, students can access it whenever they need it, whether from their phones or laptops. 

Target users are college students who want to save time and study efficiently, as well as TAs who want to share their notes. By encouraging collaboration and highlighting high-quality notes, Wolf Notes transforms scattered information into a shared learning resource.


## Feature Description


Our application will provide users with the ability to:

* Find their class section
* Upload pdfs, text, or images
* Organize notes by class, section, topic, and date
* Search and filter with tags
* View files uploaded by other students
* Rate and review specific study materials
* Leave comments or suggest edits to classmates
* Sync across devices

The rating system allows for student to upvote notes they find helpful. There is no option to downvote. The notes with the most amount of upvotes will be pushed to the top of the student view feed. 

There will be two user roles, Instructor and Student.

Instructors can: 
* Create classes.
* Remove students from a class.
* Remove notes uploaded by students.

Students can:
* Join an existing class.
* Upload their own notes.
* View other students notes.
* Upvote other notes.


### PWA Capabilities

Students often switch between their work devices and their phones. While studying long hours they may opt for a laptop, while on their way to the testing location they may opt for their mobile devices. A PWA comes in perfect use at this time. By making our application a PWA, the student can access it through the web and install it on their phones. At NC State the WiFi can be quite unreliable at times and if a student is studying during a disruption they can access the notes through the app offline and even upload content while the network is down. They can also enable notifications to be displayed whenever a new note is uploaded for one of their classes or if they receive a comment on one of their uploads.
